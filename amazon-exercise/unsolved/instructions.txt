1. Set up an amazon type page that has items and their price (at least 8 items)
2. When the browser is above a size of 1200px
  - have your items with a display of grid
3. When the browser is below 1200px and above 900px
  - keep your display at grid
  - lower the amount of columns
4. When your browser size is below 900px
  - change the display to flex
  - move all of the content to the center
5. Change the order of the items when the flex gets to the point where its only showing one item per row
   I didn't go over this, but it should be self-explanatory.
   The syntax is in the flexbox lesson: https://github.com/ccny-wd-2020/flex/blob/master/lesson/index.css#L119
